                <p> ____ Let me begin this by saying,I’m not an interesting person. Atleast, that’s what I thought. Turns out, Even
                    ordinary lives have extraordinary moments. Hi, I am Genesis Galimba Manzano currently living in Langlangca 1
                    st , Candon City, Ilocos Sur. I was born on August 16, 2003 in Banayoyo, Ilocos Sur. Yes, I wasn’t born in a hospital
                    rather in our family house, no doctor assisted just our midwife grandmother. In my early education, I went to Casilagan Elementary School in Banayoyo. An anxious and shy child
                    entering his education journey. I am a consistent honor pupil every year. In this time, I met my friend for life, should rather say brothers for life, Jexster Adviento, a joyful and intelligent friend of mine. A funny unforgettable
                    momentfor me in this time would be the time our teacher permanently left to teach in other school, literal all of my
                    classmates are crying,one is banging the door, and one just pooped his pants and there’s three of us left laughing
                    hardly in the corner, nonchalant boys. I have some impressive resume in my elementary days. I compete in many academic contest. Top three finishes in
                    District Math Contest every year, competes in Kannawidan Folk Dance, top five finishes in subject quiz like Filipino
                    Quiz, Science Quiz, third Place in MTAP Division in fifth year and many more. In Grade V, I was selected in Sepak
                    Takraw team of our school, thrower position. We won the District Meet, and proceeds to Unit Meet where we
                    lost in the grandfinals. Then in Grade 6, I became the captain, We became back to back champs in District Meet by
                    a wide margin proceeds to demolished every opponent in Unit Meet then came the Provincial Meet where the best
                    teams in Ilocos Sur competes to one another, Guess what? we place last with no wins. And that’s is the lasttime I
                    compete in a formal sports competition since I didn’t continue playing competitive sports in highschool. I
                    graduated asthe Valedictorian and the only Athlete of The Year of ourschool. And this prime days are over when I graduated. <br><br>____ I went to Banayoyo National High School for my secondary education. First day of class, nervousness and
                    anxiety was all over the place since my classmates was the top students of their respective elementary schools, competition was overwhelming. Walking into classroom feltlike stepping onto a stage mental blocked, I just hoped
                    no one noticed how nervous I was. An achievement of having a place in Spelling Bee Contest Division Level
                    kickstart my highschool journey. Intramurals takes place I switched to chess from Sepak Takraw because, I don’t even know why. Then in later
                    years of highschool, I tried Table Tennis, but lost in Intramurals. I once become the President of Math Club, helping
                    me enhance my leadership skills. I learn the hardships of being a leader in large population. Then the pandemic strucks, The joy of suspending class for a week turns to a years long of worry and isolation. In
                    the times of pandemic, felt was like all intelligence left my body. Senior High School era during pandemic was pure
                    modules, this is one of the best times for me, collaboration on answering modules, hang out in the house of one of
                    our friend almost every other day.No worries, just modules, eat,sleep again and again
                    <br><br>
                    ____ Then I went to Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College to pursue Computer Science College wasthe time I truly
                    understand what it meant to be independent, making my own decisions, managing my time, and finding my way in a
                    world that suddenly felt much bigger. I met my friends, John Marc, Jay, Sean, and Izza. They made my college more
                    joyful and enjoyable.The friendships with them in college weren’tjust bonds,they were lifelines during stressful exams
                    and projects,sick nights, and moments ofself-doubt. And here'sthe present, living life being unsure with path to follow. Thistime, I am just going with the flow of life and
                    see where ittakes me.I have paths I considertaking, AI / Machine Learning / Networking / Backend, buttil now I am
                    confused what path to take.The road is open for me to create, make my future the bestfor me and my loved ones.</p>
